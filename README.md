## Frontend Masters: The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need
Followed along with primeagen to finish the implementations, will potentially in the future recreate the data structures and algorithms on my own and the ones that weren't covered.

### Completed Algorithms

- [x]   Insertion sort
- [x]   Merge sort
- [x]   QuickSort
- [x]   Prim's MST (Adjacency List)
- [x]   Dijkstra's Shortest Path (Adjacency List)

### Completed Data Structures

- [x]   Singly linked list
- [x]   Doubly linked list
- [x]   Queue
- [x]   Stack
- [x]   Graph with Adjacency List
- [x]   Graph with Adjacency Matrix (untested)

### Running locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and yarn installed: `npm install --global yarn`

*or you can use [Bun](https://bun.dev/)*

clone the repo and install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```
*or*
```bash
bun install
```

#### Testing

```
npx jest <filename>
```
*or*
```
bunx jest <filename>
```
